    "One use of the naive Bayes classifier, which is still in practical use today, is as a spam filter.  Consider the corpus of text messages packaged with this homework, which are each labelled as either 'spam' or 'ham'.  In this case, naive Bayes utilizes a Bernoulli model that quantifies the probability of a given word given that the message is either spam or ham.  For example, investigating the text messages here, we find that the word *draw* shows up in spam 27 times, yet in ham only 5.  Thus, we have that\n",

I have also parsed a set of test data: *test_messages* is a list, each entry containing another list of the words in the text message, as well as *test_labels* which contains the spam/ham label for each message."
